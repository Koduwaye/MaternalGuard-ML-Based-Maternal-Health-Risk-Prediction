# MaternalGuard-ML-Based-Maternal-Health-Risk-Prediction
# MaternalGuard: ML-Based Maternal Health Risk Prediction  A multi-class classification system predicting maternal health risk levels using clinical vitals. Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM with extensive feature engineering  **Tech Stack:** Python • scikit-learn • XGBoost • pandas • matplotlib • seaborn
A machine learning system that predicts maternal health risk levels (low, mid, high) using clinical indicators including age, blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, and body temperature. The project implements and compares multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) with comprehensive feature engineering to enable early detection of at-risk pregnancies. XGBoost achieved the best performance with 87% accuracy and 86% recall, demonstrating the potential for ML to support clinical decision-making and reduce preventable maternal mortality.
